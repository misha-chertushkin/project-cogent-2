# 🚀 Demo Guide: Multi-Search Vendor Agent

Use these prompts to explore the agent's ability to reason across BigQuery (structured spend data) and Vertex AI Search (unstructured contract PDFs).

## 1️⃣ The "Apex Trap" (Core Demo)
*Copy this to demonstrate cross-source auditing.*
> "Check all vendors with over $100M in spend. Compare their BigQuery renewal dates with the termination dates in their contract PDFs. Are there any critical risks or discrepancies?"

## 2️⃣ Legal Deep-Dive
*Copy this to show precise grounding and exit-strategy reasoning.*
> "For Apex Logistics, summarize the 'Termination for Convenience' clause and identify the exact section in the contract. How quickly can we legally exit this agreement?"

## 3️⃣ Productivity & Action
*Copy these to show the agent performing work for the user.*
* **Email Drafting:** "Draft an urgent email to the Procurement Lead for Apex Logistics regarding the $200M uncontracted spend and the Dec 2024 expiration."
* **Data Structuring:** "Create a CSV-ready list of the 19 expired vendors, including their name and expiration date."

## 4️⃣ Strategy & Risk
*Copy this to show executive-level synthesis.*
> "Based on the fact that 19/20 contracts are expired, what are the top 3 systemic risks to our procurement process? Is this a data entry failure or a governance failure?"
